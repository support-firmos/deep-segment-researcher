    Important notes:
    - Keep all points concise and actionable - focus on quality over quantity
    - Each point should clearly connect to how a CFO service provides value
    - DO NOT include introductions, disclaimers, or conclusions.
    - Use emojis as shown in the format (not markdown formatting)
    - For each segment, use the same emoji format and numbering style
